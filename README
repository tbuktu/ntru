The NTRU Cryptosystem

  A Java implementation of the NTRU public-key cryptosystem, consisting of
  the encryption scheme NTRUEncrypt and the signature scheme NTRUSign.
  
  NTRU's main strengths are performance and resistance to quantum attacks.
  Keys are longer than with ECC but shorter than RSA.

  The implementation follows the EESS standard
  (http://grouper.ieee.org/groups/1363/lattPK/submissions/EESS1v2.pdf)
  to a certain degree, but differs in some aspects. For instance, this
  implementation does not use SHA-1 but the more secure SHA-512 hash.
  

NtruEncrypt Usage

  The first step is always to create an NtruEncrypt instance by calling the
  constructor with an EncryptionParameters object representing the desired
  algorithm parameters.
  It is recommended to use one of the predefined parameter sets which are
  available as constants in EncryptionParameters, but new ones can be created
  as well.
  
  After an NtruEncrypt instance has been created, it can be used to generate
  new key pairs, and encrypt / decrypt messages.
  
  Encrypting a message is done by calling encrypt() which takes the following
  parameters:

    1. the message itself as a byte array. Strings can be encrypted after
       converting them to byte[] via getBytes()
    2. an EncryptionPublicKey, which can be generated via
       NtruEncrypt.generateKeyPair() or an existing key can be reconstructed
       from a byte array by calling new EncryptionPublicKey(byte[])
  
  The encrypted message is returned as a byte array.

  Decrypting a message is done by calling decrypt() which takes the message,
  an EncryptionKeyPair containing the public and private keys, and the
  encryption parameters. The parameters used for decrypting must be the same as
  the ones used to encrypt the message; the same goes for the public key.


NtruSign Usage
  
  The first step is always to create an NtruSign instance by calling the
  constructor with an SignatureParameters object representing the desired
  algorithm parameters.
  It is recommended to use one of the predefined parameter sets which are
  available as constants in SignatureParameters, but new ones can be created
  as well.
  
  After the NtruSign constructor is called, the NtruSign instance can be
  used to generate new key pairs, sign messages, and verify signatures.
  
  Signing a message is done by calling NtruSign.sign() which takes the following
  parameters:

    1. the message itself as a byte array. Strings can be signed after converting
       them to byte[] via getBytes()
    2. a SignatureKeyPair, which can be generated via NtruSign.generateKeyPair()
       or an existing key pair can be reconstructed from a byte array using the
       SignaturePrivateKey(byte[]) and SignaturePublicKey(byte[]).
       Note: Depending on the parameters, it can take a minute or more to
       generate a new key pair.
  
  The signature is returned as a byte array.

  Verifying a message is done by calling NtruSign.verify() which takes the message,
  the signature, and the SignaturePublicKey. The parameters used for verifying must
  be the same as the ones used to create the signature; the same goes for the public
  key.


Key Import / Export

  Encryption keys and signature keys can be written to a file via the writeTo methods
  by supplying a FileOutputStream. The key can then be read from the file by passing
  a FileInputStream to the appropriate constructor.
  
  Keys are encoded raw, so the array contains no information about the parameters
  used. It is advisable to first write the parameters, then the key. Parameters can
  be written to an OutputStream just like keys, and just like keys they have a
  constructor that takes an InputStream.

  Keys can also be converted to and from byte arrays.
